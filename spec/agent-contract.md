# Agent Contract

1. Always load `spec/invariants.json` before modifying code or specs.
2. Always load `spec/overview.md` to understand the system context.
2. Load `spec/glossary.md` to maintain consistent vocabulary.
3. Prefer reading existing code over inventing new patterns.
4. Respect naming conventions and glossary terms.
5. Never introduce cross-layer violations unless explicitly approved.
6. Keep changes small and scoped unless a refactor is requested.
7. Suggest updates to the spec or invariants when appropriate.
